title: "Analyzing Twitter Data (Currently Partially Complete)"

**Goal**: Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) developed with tensorflow, develop an application that can identify a sentiment of a tweet and make this available as a flask application on Amazon's web service elastic beanstalk.

This is a project that I am currently working on. Here is an image of a wordcloud of the positive tweets from me protoyping the model where, using [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/), I query twitter on the topic of "Atlanta". It happened to be MLK day the day that I tested it.

**Results**: Currently the RNN has been built and using tweepy tweets can be collected on a particular topic. The model has been saved and is ready to be implemented on a flask application on Amazon's elastic beanstalk.
