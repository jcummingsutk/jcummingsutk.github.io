<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To develop an accurate linear, polynomial, and ridge polynomial regression model to predict the amount of ozone in the air.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Using historical weather data paired with EPA data on ozone pollutant a polynomial regression model with R^2 of 0.76 and a MAE of .0064 and RMSE .0085 ppm on the test set is developed. There is some amount of overfitting on the training set with this model, as the MAE and RMSE on the training set are .054 and .069 respectively. However, this overfitting is relatively mild and ridge regression does not appear to do any better on the test set.</p>
<p>Possible extensions: A couple improvements I&rsquo;d like to make is I&rsquo;d like to capture the tail of this distribution better. The model could be built to more heavily penalize inaccuracies in the higher end of the ozone range, to attempt to be a more conservative predictor. I think that importing a custom loss function to penalize the error made at higher ozone levels could be helpful here. There is also the issue of linear regression models predicting negative ozone levels. However, this is not as concerning to me as we can consider those to be zero.</p>
