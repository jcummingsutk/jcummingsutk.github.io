Conservative here is in the sense that we&amp;rsquo;d like to have a maximize recall. Good is in the sense that we still want our classifier to have reasonable accuracy.
Results: A number of different classifiers with a number of feature engineering approaches performing at varying recall levels. The Logistic Regression model resulting from this project performs with 84 percent recall and 76 percent accuracy on the test set, and this model is deployed as a flask application on Heroku.</description></item><item><title>A Rebecca Guay Artist Classifier</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/guay_classifier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/guay_classifier/</guid><description>Goal: The purpose for this project is twofold. Immediately, this is a curiosity project, as I wanted to see if I could use techniques I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from convolutional neural networks (CNN) not to just identify objects, but also artist styles. Second, it serves as a precursor to one day creating a neural transfer project which takes an input of art and &amp;ldquo;guayifies&amp;rdquo; it, turning it into art in the style of Rebecca Guay.</description></item><item><title>Get in Touch</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Want to chat?

Results: A logistic regression and gradient boosting classifier that are 77% and 78% accurate on the test data set, respectively, with geographical interpretable logistic regression coefficients. A heatmap interpretation of these coefficients corresponding to the location data is also implemented through the google maps python package.
