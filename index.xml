Conservative here is in the sense that we&amp;rsquo;d like to have a maximize recall. Good is in the sense that we still want our classifier to have reasonable accuracy.
Results: A number of different classifiers with a number of feature engineering approaches performing at varying recall levels. The Logistic Regression model resulting from this project performs with 84 percent recall and 76 percent accuracy on the test set, and this model is deployed as a flask application on Heroku.</description></item><item><title>A Rebecca Guay Artist Classifier</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/guay_classifier/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/guay_classifier/</guid><description>Goal: The purpose for this project is twofold. Immediately, this is a curiosity project, as I wanted to see if I could use techniques I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from convolutional neural networks (CNN) not to just identify objects, but also artist styles. Second, it serves as a precursor to one day creating a neural transfer project which takes an input of art and &amp;ldquo;guayifies&amp;rdquo; it, turning it into art in the style of Rebecca Guay.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing Twitter Data (Currently in Progress)</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/twitter_classification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/twitter_classification/</guid><description>Goal: Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) developed with Tensorflow, develop an application that can identify a sentiment of a tweet and make this available as a flask application on Amazon&amp;rsquo;s web service elastic beanstalk. Using this RNN with the tweepy API, this project should have the end result of being able to scrape tweets from the twitter API on any topic and get positive and negative tweets.
The principal application that I can see for this project is for any company that has an online presence, this would be useful as a real-time monitoring system.</description></item><item><title>Get in Touch</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Want to chat?

However, ground level ozone has well documented negative effects. Those with Asthma are particularly at risk to it [1]. Denver has one of the worst levels of ground level ozone in the united states [2]. It is well known that ozone is greatly affected by pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, etc.</description></item><item><title>Predicting Housing Assistance Recipients</title><link>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/fulton_era_predictor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jcummingsutk.github.io/post/fulton_era_predictor/</guid><description>Goal: Develop a predictor for recipients of the Emergency Rent and Utility Assistance program in Fulton County.
Results: A logistic regression and gradient boosting classifier that are 77% and 78% accurate on the test data set, respectively, with geographical interpretable logistic regression coefficients. A heatmap interpretation of these coefficients corresponding to the location data is also implemented through the google maps python package.
